                Here's how it works:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Create a article. üì¶
                    </strong>

                    You can write an article in markdown.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Submit it for review. ‚è≥
                    </strong>

                    One of the Filament team will review your submission and approve it for our blog.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Once approved ‚úÖ,
                    </strong>

                    your article will be listed on our blog. You can edit it at any time.
                </li>
