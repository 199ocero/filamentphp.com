description: Filament Resource Lock is a Filament plugin that adds resource locking functionality to your site. When a user begins editing a resource, Filament Resource Lock automatically locks the resource to prevent other users from editing it at the same time. The resource will be automatically unlocked after a set period of time, or when the user saves or discards their changes.
