I'm a Laravel-developer. Usually I spend my time doing freelance work and my university study (Business Economics).
In the meantime I also write about PHP, Laravel, Tailwind & more on my personal blog, [**ralphjsmit.com**](https://ralphjsmit.com). (If you're interested, subscribe to my newsletter to occasionally receive an email with some updates.)
